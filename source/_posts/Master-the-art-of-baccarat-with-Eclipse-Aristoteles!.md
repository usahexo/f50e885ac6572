# 5. Baccarat made easy with Eclipse Aristoteles!

Eclipse Aristoteles is a handy tool for playing baccarat. It offers an easy-to-use graphical interface, letting you make all the necessary bets with just a few clicks. The program also provides useful information about the game, including the probability of each outcome. This can help you make more informed decisions while playing and increase your chances of winning.

Eclipse Aristoteles is available free of charge on the Eclipse Gaming website. It works with most major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The program requires Adobe Flash Player to run, so make sure you have it installed before trying to use it.

To get started, visit the Eclipse Gaming website and download Eclipse Aristoteles. Once you have it installed, open the program and click on the Baccarat tab. You will then see a list of all the available baccarat tables at the casino. To join a table, click on its name and then click on the Play button.

You will now see a table similar to the one shown in Figure 1. This displays all the important information about the current game. The bottom half of the table lists all your current bets, while the top half shows your potential winnings (or losses) if those bets are successful.

    


 

 

 
The bet area in the top left corner of the table lets you place your chips on different parts of the game grid. To place a bet, click on one of the squares and then drag your mouse over to where you want to put it. A chip will then be placed in that square and cannot be moved until after the end of the hand.

The controls at the bottom of the screen let you change your betting options. The six buttons allow you to make standard bets such as Player or Banker, as well as more exotic wagers like Ties or Dragon Wagering (more on these later). There is also a slider that lets you adjust your bet size from 1 to 500 chips per hand.

Once you have made your bets, hit Deal to begin play. The cards will be dealt out automatically and shown in two separate areas above and below the bet grid (see Figure 2). You can either keep your current cards or exchange them for new ones by clicking on one of two buttons at either end of each row.

   



 

 If you want to cancel your cards and get new ones, hit Exchange Cards instead. When all players have either decided to keep their cards or exchange them for new ones, hit Stand button to finish play for that hand. The Dealer's hand is then revealed, along with everyone's payout (if any).

There are several different types of bets that you can place in Eclipse Aristoteles:

Player: corresponds to betting on whether Player will win or lose
Banker: corresponds to betting on whether Banker will win or lose  Tie: corresponds to betting that there will be a draw between Player and Banker (winner takes nothing) Dragon Wagering: allows you to bet that one specific player (either P1 or B1) will win
