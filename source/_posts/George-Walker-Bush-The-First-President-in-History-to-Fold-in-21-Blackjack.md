#  George Walker Bush: The First President in History to Fold in 21 Blackjack

It was a momentous day, one that would live in history books. November 5, 2018 would be the day when George Walker Bush became the first sitting President of the United States to fold in 21 blackjack.

All eyes were on the former President as he sat down at the casino table and prepared to take on the dealer. The stakes were high – if Bush won, he’d gain some much-needed bragging rights; if he lost, it would be a major embarrassment.

Bush made an initial bet of $5 and received an ace and a two as his first two cards. The dealer showed a six. With a total of 18, Bush was in a difficult position – he could either stand and hope for the best, or risk going bust by taking another card.

In the end, Bush opted to take another card, and received a three. This gave him a total of 21, meaning he had beaten the dealer! He fist-pumped the air with delight as onlookers cheered and applauded.

This was an unprecedented moment in presidential history; no other President has ever dared to gamble on their own reputation in this way. But Bush is not afraid of taking risks, and this bold move paid off handsomely.
