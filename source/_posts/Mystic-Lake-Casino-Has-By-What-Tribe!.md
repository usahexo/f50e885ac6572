#  Mystic Lake Casino Has By What Tribe!

The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community is a tribe of Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate people who live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. The tribe owns and operates the Mystic Lake Casino.

The tribe traces their ancestry to the Dakota people who lived in the area when it was part of the Dakota Territory. In 1851, they were relocated to a reservation on the Spirit Lake Reservation in Iowa. In 1889, they were moved again to the Sisseton Wahpeton Reservation in South Dakota.

In 1902, the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux merged with the Waubun band of Ojibwe people and took on their name. In 1934, they were granted federal recognition as an Indian tribe. In 1999, they opened the Mystic Lake Casino as one of the first Native American casinos in the country.

Today, the Mystic Lake Casino employs more than 2,000 people and generates over $200 million in annual revenue for the tribe. The casino has helped fund tribal programs and services including education, housing, health care, and economic development.

#  Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe and Fond du Lac Win $5.5M in Court Over Mystic Lake Casino Revenue

The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians won a $5.5 million judgment in federal court against their neighboring casino, Mystic Lake Casino, for failing to share gaming revenue as agreed.

The two bands signed a revenue-sharing agreement in 1996 that granted the Fond du Lac a 33% share of net winnings from the casino. In 2006, Mystic Lake revised its operating agreement to drop the Fond du Lac's share to 10%.

The Mille Lacs Band argued that the change violated the 1996 agreement and filed suit in 2009. The court ruled in favor of the Mille Lacs Band, awarding it $5.5 million in damages plus interest.

"This is a major victory for our tribe and reinforces our sovereign rights," said Mille Lacs Band Chief Executive Melanie Benjamin. "We are proud to have stood up for ourselves and defended our rights against Mystic Lake Casino's blatant breach of contract."

Mystic Lake Casino has not yet announced whether it will appeal the ruling.

The Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake, Minnesota, announced on Wednesday that it will pay out millions of dollars to three Minnesota Indian tribes. The casino is owned and operated by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC), and the payouts are part of a revenue-sharing agreement between the casino and the tribes.

The money will be used by the tribes to fund education, social welfare, and economic development programs.

The payments are part of an overall revenue sharing agreement between the casino and the tribes that has been in place since 2002. The total amount paid out to the tribes over the years exceeds $100 million. “The revenue sharing payments from Mystic Lake Casino have been a critical source of funding for our communities,” said Prairie Island Tribal Chairman Fahy or his predecessor “We are grateful for this partnership with Mystic Lake Casino which helps us provide jobs and critically needed resources for our tribal members.”

The SMSC is one of 11 federally recognized Indian tribes in Minnesota. It is made up of members of the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota nations who have lived in the area for hundreds of years. In addition to its casino operations, the tribe owns two hotels and a golf course near Minneapolis.
