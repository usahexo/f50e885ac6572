#  Delaware Online Sports Betting Sites - What Kinds Are Available?

Delaware is one of the states in the US where sports betting is legal. This means that there are a number of Delaware online sports betting sites that are available to residents. However, not all of these sites offer the same types of bets or games. It can be confusing to try to figure out which site offers what, especially if you're new to sports betting.

In this article, we'll take a look at some of the different types of sports bets that are available at Delaware online sports betting sites. We'll also provide information about the various sites that offer these bets so that you can decide which site is right for you.

There are three main types of sports bets that are offered at Delaware online sports betting sites: point spreads, totals, and moneylines. We'll take a look at each of these types of bets below.

Point Spreads

A point spread bet is a bet on which team will win the game, but with the point spread factored in. The team that is favored will have a point spread assigned to them, and the underdog will have a negative point spread assigned to them. For example, if Team A is favored by 4 points and Team B is the underdog, then Team B would need to win the game by more than 4 points in order to win the bet. If they only win by 3 points, then they would lose the bet even though they technically won the game.

Totals

A total bet is a bet on how many points will be scored in a particular game. You can either wager that there will be more or less than the projected total set by the sportsbook. For example, if the total set by the sportsbook for a football game is 45 points, you could wager that there will be more than 45 points scored (the over) or less than 45 points scored (the under).

Moneylines

A moneyline bet is simply a bet on who will win the game. There is no point spread involved; instead, you are simply betting on which team will come out on top. The team with shorter odds (the favorite) will payout less money than the team with longer odds (the underdog).

#  Delaware Sports Betting Guide - How to Place Bets on Your Favourite Sport

Delaware is one of the early adopters of sports betting, legalizing it in 2012. This guide will teach you the basics of how to place bets on your favourite sport in Delaware.

To begin, you'll need to head to a casino that offers sports betting. The two casinos in Delaware that offer this are Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway. Once you're there, you'll need to go to the betting area and find the board that shows all of the available sporting events.

Here's an example:

Once you've found the event you're interested in, look for the odds next to it. These represent how likely or unlikely the event is to happen - the higher the number, the less likely it is. In this example, we can see that Manchester City is expected to beat Swansea City 3-0. If we wanted to place a bet on this outcome, we would need to find a bookmaker who would offer us favourable odds - perhaps 10/11 or even shorter. 

If we think Swansea City will pull off an upset and beat Manchester City, we can find odds of 14/5 at most bookmakers. This means that for every £5 we wager, we would win back £14 plus our original stake.

It's important to remember that not all sportsbooks will offer the same odds on every match - so it's worth doing some research before placing any bets.

Some other things you'll need to know include how much you can bet and how to cash out your winnings. With regards to betting limits, each casino sets its own maximums and minimums; so it's best to check with staff at the individual casino before placing any bets. As for cashing out your winnings, this process generally varies from bookmaker to bookmaker - so be sure to familiarize yourself with their withdrawal procedures before signing up.
