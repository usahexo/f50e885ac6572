#  How to beat the casino with Joel Coen's craps strategy!

## Introduction

In the movie "The Big Lebowski", Jeff Bridges' character, The Dude, demonstrates an ingenious craps strategy to his would-be assailants. While the plan may not be perfect, it's certainly a step up from simply throwing your money away at the casino!

In this article, we'll take a look at how The Dude's craps strategy works, and how you can use it to beat the casino. Let's get started!

## The basics of The Dude's craps strategy

At its core, The Dude's craps strategy is really quite simple. Here's how it works:

1. Wait for a come-out roll of 7 or 11.

2. If you roll a 7, bet on the Pass Line. If you roll an 11, bet on Don't Pass.

3. If you roll any other number, bet on the point number (the number that was rolled).

4. If the point number is rolled before a 7 is rolled, keep betting on the point number. If a 7 is rolled before the point number, then switch to betting on the Pass Line.


Now let's take a look at each of these steps in more detail.

1. Wait for a come-out roll of 7 or 11: As mentioned earlier, you should wait for either a come-out roll of 7 or 11 before starting to play. This gives you a good chance of winning right off the bat!


2. If you roll a 7, bet on the Pass Line: If you roll a 7 on your come-out roll, then you should bet on the Pass Line from thereon out. This increases your chances of winning and minimizes your risk exposure.

3. If you roll any other number, bet on the point number: If you don't roll a 7 or an 11 on your come-out roll, then you should start betting on the point number instead. This is also a good strategy for maximising your chances of winning in subsequent rounds.

4. If the point number is rolled before a 7 is rolled: Finally, if the point number is rolled before a 7 is rolled, keep betting on that same point number until it either comes up or until you lose all your money!

A lot of people shy away from playing craps in a casino because they think it's too complicated. But with the right tips, you can roll the perfect dice - and increase your chances of winning big!

 Bet on the pass line - this is one of the simplest bets in craps, and it gives you a decent chance of winning without risking too much money.

Make odds bets - these bets offer good odds and can pay out handsomely if you hit a lucky streak.

Avoid hard 8s and 11s - these are known as 'craps' or 'natural' numbers, and they're notoriously difficult to beat.

There is no denying that the craps table can be daunting for first-time players. The flurry of activity, paperwork and dice can be overwhelming. That said, with a little bit of practice and some solid tips, you can become a craps whiz in no time!

The first thing to keep in mind is that craps is all about odds. As such, it's important to understand the different types of bets you can make and their corresponding odds. There are several basic bets in craps - pass, come, don't pass and don't come - which we'll discuss further below.

When playing craps, always make sure to place your bets on the table. Don't put them in the middle of the table or in front of you - this will just slow down the game for everyone else. Most importantly, have fun and remember that it's all just a game!
