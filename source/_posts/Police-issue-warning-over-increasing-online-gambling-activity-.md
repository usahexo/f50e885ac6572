#  Police issue warning over increasing online gambling activity 

Police have warned the public to be vigilant of increasing online gambling activity, as criminals take advantage of people’s lack of knowledge around the activity.

Detective Superintendent Jason Tingley said that investigators had recently noticed a spike in online scams and extortion attempts related to gambling, with victims often lured into placing bets with illegitimate websites.

“We are seeing an increase in this type of offending where people are being scammed or extorted into making bets with illegitimate gambling websites,” Detective Superintendent Tingley said.

“Victims can be left out of pocket and in some cases, they can be threatened if they don’t pay up.


#  How to report illegal gambling and the dangers of getting involved 

Illegal gambling is a problem that affects communities across the United States. It can lead to a host of other criminal activities, including money laundering, loan sharking and extortion.

If you witness illegal gambling in your community, it is important to report it to the authorities. Below are some tips on how to report illegal gambling.

First, identify where the gambling is taking place. Is it in someone's home? In a casino or racetrack? In a public place?

Once you've identified where the gambling is taking place, contact your local police department or sheriff's office. Provide them with as many details as possible, including the location of the gambling, the type of gambling activity, and any information you have on the people involved.

Be prepared to give a statement to law enforcement officials. They may want to interview you or even ask you to testify in court.

If you have been affected by illegal gambling, such as if you've lost money or been threatened by someone involved in illegal gambling, please contact your local police department or sheriff's office immediately. They can help protect you and provide resources for those who have been harmed by illegal gambling.

#  ISP's asked to help crackdown on illegal gambling websites 

ISP's have been asked by the UK Gambling Commission to help crackdown on illegal gambling websites. This follows news that the commission is to start civil proceedings against 10 individuals it believes are involved in running illegal gambling websites.

The commission has written to all of the UK's major ISP's, asking them to block access to the websites. It is thought that this could involve the use of web filters, which would stop people from accessing the sites.

The commission is also urging people not to use these websites, as they are not authorised or regulated by the UK Gambling Commission. It warned that using unlicensed websites could lead to financial losses and criminal prosecution.

This is not the first time that the commission has asked ISP's to help crackdown on illegal gambling websites. In 2013, it wrote to all of the UK's major ISP's, asking them to block access to a number of unlicensed websites.

#  Online Gambling Regulations - What You Need To Know 

The gambling industry is a massive one, and online gambling is becoming more and more popular. Different countries have different laws regulating gambling, so it can be tricky to know what is legal and what isn't when it comes to online betting and casino games. In this article, we'll take a look at the different gambling regulations around the world, as well as some of the current issues and controversies surrounding online gambling.

Europe 

Europe has a relatively relaxed attitude towards gambling, and most countries in the region have little or no regulation of online gambling operators. This has resulted in a booming industry, with many operators setting up shop in countries like Malta and Gibraltar. However, there are signs that this laissez faire attitude may be changing; in March 2018 the European Court of Justice ruled that Member States could outlaw online gambling sites from within their territory, even if those sites were licensed in another EU country.

This ruling is likely to result in a patchwork of different regulations across Europe, as each country decides how to best implement the court's ruling. It will also be interesting to see whether more restrictive regulations will have an impact on the industry; some analysts are predicting that there will be a rise in black market activity as people seek to bypass stricter regulations.

North America 

Online gambling is legal in some form in most North American jurisdictions, although there are variations between states and provinces. The majority of states allow some form of internet betting, while only three - Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware - have legalized full-scale online casinos. There has been some opposition to online gambling from religious groups and others who argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems, but so far there has been no serious push to restrict or outlaw online gambling at the federal level.

Latin America 

Online gambling is legal in most Latin American countries, although there are variations between jurisdictions. Brazil was one of the first countries in the region to legalize online poker, followed by Mexico and Argentina. Colombia recently passed legislation legalizing all forms of online gambling except for sports betting. Unlike Europe and North America, there has been little resistance to online gambling from religious or social groups; instead, regulators have been keen to embrace new technologies and attract foreign investment into the sector.

Asia Pacific 

Online gambling is legal in a number of Asia Pacific jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Macau, and Thailand. Each country has its own set of regulations governing how operators can market their products and which games are allowed. There has been some controversy around Asian casinos; for example Macau has been accused of being a 'money laundering haven' for Chinese triads. However overall the industry is growing rapidly with new territories opening up all the time.

#  How to protect yourself from illegal gambling

Illegal gambling is a scourge on our society. It preys on the weak and vulnerable, and can cause immense harm to individuals and families. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from illegal gambling:

* Know your state's laws on gambling. Each state has different laws regarding gambling, so it's important to know what is legal in your state.

* Don't gamble with money you can't afford to lose. Gambling should always be considered a form of entertainment, and not a way to make money. If you can't afford to lose the money, don't gamble it.

* Only gamble with reputable casinos or gaming sites. There are many illegitimate gambling sites out there, so it's important to do your research before deciding where to play.

* Keep track of your spending. Gambling can be addictive, and before you know it you may find yourself spending more money than you planned on gambling. Keep track of your spending so you don't get into financial trouble.

* Don't drink or take drugs while gambling. Alcohol and drugs can impair your judgement and make it more likely that you'll lose money while gambling.

* Set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much money you're willing to gamble each day / week / month, and stick to those limits. That way you won't lose more money than you can afford to lose.
