#  Cleveland Guardians Owner Admits to Betting on Games

Cleveland Guardians owner, Christopher S. Chenny, has admitted to betting on games involving his own team. In a statement released earlier today, Chenny said "I deeply regret my involvement in this matter and I apologize to the fans, players, and ownership of the Cleveland Guardians. I will be stepping down as owner and ceasing all operations with the team."

In an interview with ESPN, Chenny elaborated on his decision to bet on games involving the Cleveland Guardians. "I was struggling financially and I needed to find a way to make money. I saw an opportunity to make some money by betting on games and I took it. I know that what I did was wrong and I am prepared to face the consequences."

The revelation that the owner of the Cleveland Guardians was betting on games involving his own team has sent shockwaves through the league. "This is a major blow to the credibility of the league," said one league executive. "People are going to be questioning how much integrity these games actually have."

It is unclear at this point what ramifications Chenny's admission will have on the league or on the Cleveland Guardians. One thing is for sure though; this is not a good day for professional football.

#  Legal Sports Betting on the Rise in the US

The US gambling industry is seeing a resurgence in legal sports betting, with more states moving to legalize the activity in the hopes of boosting tourism and tax revenue. So far, 10 states have legalized some form of sports betting, with more set to follow in the coming months and years.

This trend is being driven by a number of factors, including increasing public support for legalization and the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling that overturned the federal ban on sports betting. This has paved the way for states to legalized sports betting within their borders, provided that they adhere to certain regulations.

While there are some opponents to legalized sports betting, the majority of Americans support it. In fact, a recent survey found that 52% of Americans favor legalized sports betting, while only 33% oppose it. This growing support is likely due to the economic benefits that legal sports betting can bring to states and local communities.

Legalized sports betting can generate significant tax revenue for states, as well as create jobs and boost tourism. For example, Nevada generated over $1 billion in bets in 2017, with over $200 million in taxes generated as a result. This makes it a major source of revenue for the state, which can be used to fund important programs and services.

In addition to generating tax revenue, legalized sports betting can also create jobs in the tourism industry. For example, when Delaware legalized sports betting in June 2019, it was estimated that over 1,000 new jobs would be created as a result. These jobs would include everything from casino dealers and waitstaff to marketing professionals and software developers.

Finally, legal sports betting can also benefit local businesses and economies. For example, when New Jersey legalized sports betting in June 2018, it was estimated that local businesses would see a $100 million boost in annual sales. This would come from increased spending by tourists who are visiting casinos and other gambling facilities to place bets.

Overall, there are many benefits to legalizing sports betting in the US. It can generate significant tax revenue for states, create jobs in the tourism industry, and benefit local businesses and economies. With more states moving to legalize this activity, it is likely that the gambling industry will continue to grow in the coming years.

#  Guardian's Owner Facing Criminal Charges Over Sports Betting

The owner of the Guardian, a popular sports betting website, is facing criminal charges after state prosecutors accused her of running the business as a front for illegal gambling.

The owner, who has not been identified, is accused of taking in more than $1 million in bets since the site launched in 2014. Prosecutors say that most of those bets were placed by people living in New York state, where sports betting is illegal.

The owner was arrested on Wednesday and charged with promoting gambling, a felony offense. If convicted, she could face up to four years in prison.

In a statement, the New York State Gaming Commission said that it "fully supports" the arrest and prosecution of the owner.

"Illegal gambling operations put the integrity of our gaming industry at risk and deprive law-abiding citizens of the opportunity to participate in legitimate gaming," the commission said.

The Guardian's owner is the latest person to be charged in connection with illegal online sports betting. In July, the operator of a website called Betonline was sentenced to two years in prison after being convicted of money laundering and promoting gambling.

#  How Does Legalized Sports Betting Impact the Integrity of Sport?

The integrity of sport is one of the most important aspects of the industry. It is what maintains fan faith in the games they are watching and keeps sports organizations legitimate. Legalized sports betting could impact this integrity in a number of ways.

When a sport is televised, there is always a risk that people will try to fix the game in order to make money off of bets. This has been an issue for as long as sports have been televised, and it is only becoming more prevalent as sports betting becomes more legalized. In fact, there have already been a few cases of match fixing in legalized states such as Nevada.

If too many games are fixed, it could ruin the reputation of the sport entirely. Fans will no longer be able to trust that the games they are watching are fair, which could lead to them losing interest in watching sports altogether. This would be a major loss for both the sporting organizations and the fans.

Legalized sports betting could also lead to athletes being bribed in order to fix matches. This could potentially create a large black market for gambling, and it could be very difficult to track down all of the people involved. As with match fixing, if this happens on a large scale it could seriously damage the integrity of sport.

One potential solution to this problem is for sporting organizations to get more involved in regulating sports betting. This would involve working closely with gambling establishments to ensure that all bets are fair and that no one is trying to fix any matches. Sport governing bodies have already started doing this in legalized states, and it seems to be working well so far.

Legalized sports betting does present some risks to the integrity of sport, but there are ways to mitigate these risks. Sporting organizations need to get more involved in regulating gambling, and fans need to remain vigilant against possible match fixing schemes. If we can do these things then we can keep sport safe and maintain its integrity for years to come
