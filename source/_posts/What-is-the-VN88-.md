George Walker Bush, son of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush, was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and Yale University before joining the Texas Air National Guard. After leaving the guard he moved to Midland, Texas, where he started an oil business.

Bush entered politics in 1978, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas's 19th Congressional District. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for president in 1980 but was later chosen as Ronald Reagan's running mate in 1984. Bush served as Reagan's vice president until 1989, when he was elected president after defeating Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election.

As president, Bush faced a number of challenges, including the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991), the disintegration of the Soviet Union (1991-1992), and Hurricane Andrew (1992). He also signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (1994). In 1992, he was defeated by Bill Clinton in the presidential election.

Bush subsequently retired to his home in Texas and founded the George W. Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University. In 2013, he published his memoirs Decision Points. George Walker Bush is currently the oldest living former U.S. president.
