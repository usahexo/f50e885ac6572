#  Get Ready for Some Casino Royale Action with Daniel Craig!

There is no doubting that Daniel Craig is a fantastic actor and his portrayal of James Bond in Casino Royale was nothing short of amazing. If you're looking forward to some more Bond action then be sure to check out the new movie, Quantum of Solace, which is set to hit theaters this November.

As with the first movie, Casino Royale, much of the action in Quantum of Solace will take place in casinos. In fact, the title of the movie is derived from a passage in Ian Fleming's 1956 novelization of Casino Royale. So if you're looking for some excitement and intrigue then you'll definitely want to check out Quantum of Solace when it comes out later this year.

#  Watch Casino Royale Online and see Why Daniel Craig is so Awesome!

Casino Royale is the 21st film in the James Bond series, produced by Eon Productions and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment. It stars Daniel Craig as James Bond, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, Judi Dench as M, and Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis.

The film begins with James Bond (Daniel Craig) earning his licence to kill and being assigned his first mission by MI6 head M (Judi Dench). Bond travels to Madagascar where he meets his contact Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) from the CIA and is briefed about the ongoing situation. Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a private banker to terrorist organisations, has raised suspicion in the Financial Action Task Force and they believe he will be trying to finance a major terrorist attack. Bond pursues him to a casino in Montenegro; Casino Royale.

Bond beats Le Chiffre at baccarat and takes him captive. He interrogates Le Chiffre for information on his clients and arranges to have him tortured by his friend and fellow agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) in order to get him to give up the names of his clients. However, during torture he admits that he never carried out the attacks he was paid for and that he agrees to work with MI6 to track down the terrorists. In return for his cooperation, Bond agrees not to kill him.

Back in London, M confronts Bond about goings-on in Montenegro; she was not aware of his undercover operation. He Les Chiffre have been identified but there are concerns that too much scrutiny may be placed on MI6 if it is revealed that an MI6 agent was involved in terrorist activity. Bond is given 24 hours to find the terrorists and destroy their organisation.

He recruits Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a treasury employee working at the casino, who agrees to help him because she wants revenge on Le Chiffre for her dead boyfriend. They transfer funds from Le Chiffre's accounts into those of a subsidiary of Quantum—a mysterious organisation that Vesper's employer Liquidity Services has been dealing with secretly. During a meeting between M, Bond and Vesper Lynd, Quantum assassins attempt to kill M but Bond kills them all.

Bond suspects that Vesper is working for Quantum; he guesses correctly that she retrieved the money from the villains' accounts so that it could be laundered through her company's accounts without arousing suspicion. He tells M this just before they attend an opera at which Vesper is due to meet Quantum representative Mr White (Jesper Christensen). She does not show up, however, so Bond leaves without her after making sure she will be safe back at headquarters.

Bond follows White back to a building where they meet up with another Quantum member, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Greene propositions Bond with an offer: betray MI6 and defect over to Quantum in exchange for double-crossing Vesper Lynd and guaranteeing her safety; Greene also claims that Quantum Bare already successfully blackmailed government ministers across Europe using similar leverage.. Angered by Vesper's deathbed betrayal, 007 refuses Greene's offer outright]]. A fight ensues in which Greene stabs 007 but is subsequently killed by Camille Montes ( Olga Kurylenko), who had earlier been pursuing revenge against Greene for murdering her family when she was younger .
In a hospital bed recovering from his injuries received during the fight with Greene,, Mr White phoned Bonds superior girl M congratulating her on 007 successful outing claiming Credit must go where credit due - You should have brought deck chairs This confirms suspicions raised earlier that White was working for both organizations007 completes his mission by ensuring Greene's investors does not gain control of Bolivia's water supply thus preventing any major terroristic act and preventing further casualties .}

Casino Royale introduces Daniel Craig as Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 . The movie cleverly combines plot lines from Fleming's initial novel of 1954 novel "Casino Royale" with 1967 television episode "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". The blending of old material with new provides superb continuity while presenting an updated interpretation of Agent 007 - one free of camp or overt silliness found previously in some movies within this genre Craig inhabits this latest version brilliantly , projecting both physical power as well as emotional vulnerability as warranted Opportunities seem purposely designed showcasing Daniel Craig playing opposite talented actresses such as Eva Green Ivana Milicevic , etcetera thereby also providing eye candy  Villain Mads Mikkelson adequately creepy Though some action scenes go on too long all In all CR is solidly entertaining throughout its 144 minute running time - helped immensely by great music scoreAn excellent reboot type entry definitely worth watching whether or not you are familiar with previous James Bond movies Franchise fans should be especially pleased!
