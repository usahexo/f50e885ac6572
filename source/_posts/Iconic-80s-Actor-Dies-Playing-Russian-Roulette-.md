#  Tragic End To A Hollywood Icon 

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the body of 41-year-old actor and comedian Robin Williams was found in his Northern California home. The preliminary cause of death is believed to be suicide.

This is a tragic end to a Hollywood icon. Williams first came to prominence as a regular on the popular TV series Mork & Mindy, and went on to star in a string of successful comedies including Mrs. Doubtfire and Good Morning, Vietnam. He also won an Academy Award for his role in the 1997 drama Good Will Hunting.

More recently, Williams had been struggling with addiction and depression. In a 2009 interview with ABC News, he disclosed that he had been sober for over 20 years but was still battling occasional bouts of depression. "It's [depression] just one of those things that I dealt with," he said at the time.

Williams is survived by his wife,Susan Schneider, and three children - Zachary Pym, Zelda Rae and Cody Alan. Our thoughts are with them during this difficult time.

#  Late Actor's Fatal Russian Roulette Game 

On the morning of March 10th, prominent Hollywood actor, Anton Yelchin, was found dead outside his home. The 27-year-old had been killed after his Jeep rolled down the driveway and pinned him against a mailbox post.

Less than two weeks later, autopsy results revealed that Yelchin had died from blunt traumatic asphyxia due to being pinned between the car and the mailbox. 

However, new details have since emerged that show Yelchin's death may not have been an accident at all. According to law enforcement officials, Yelchin was playing a game of Russian roulette with a friend in the hours leading up to his death.

It is believed that Yelchin lost control of the car while playing the deadly game, resulting in his accidental death. While still under investigation, this new information has cast doubt on whether Yelchin's death was truly an accident.

#  Hollywood Legend Struggles With Death 

For anyone who has ever seen an episode of "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew," it will come as no surprise that Hollywood legend Dick Van Dyke is struggling with death. The 91-year-old actor has been very open about his health issues in recent years, and he recently revealed that he doesn't have long to live.

Van Dyke made the revelation during an appearance on NBC's "Today" show, where he opened up about his recent battle with pneumonia. He also told hosts Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford that he had been told by doctors that he only has a few days left to live.

"The doctors said,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) 'This is it.' And I said, 'I'm sorry, what did you say?' And they said, 'You have pneumonia and you have sepsis and we have to hospitalize you and there's a good chance you're not going to make it,'" Van Dyke recalled.

Fortunately, Van Dyke was able to pull through after spending time in the hospital, but it was a close call. And while his health may be improving for the moment, Van Dyke knows that his time is limited.

"It was just amazing that I got through it," he said of his bout with pneumonia. "But the doctor says I've only got a couple of days left now."

Van Dyke isn't the first celebrity to publicly reveal their struggles with death. In fact, over the past few years there has been a noticeable trend of celebrities opening up about their health issues and mortality in a bid to help others facing similar struggles feel less alone. Actors like Patrick Swayze, Robin Williams, and Glen Campbell all chose to speak out about their illnesses before passing away.

While some may find these disclosures morbid or depressing, many believe that they can be incredibly helpful in terms of raising awareness and helping people grappling with terminal illness feel less isolated. In fact, studies have shown that simply expressing thoughts and feelings about death can actually increase quality of life for those nearing the end of their lives.

So far there is no word from Van Dyke on how he plans to spend his last days or what he wants people to know about his experience with death. But we can hope that by speaking out about his struggles, he will help others feel more comfortable discussing this difficult topic openly.
