#  Nevada Regulators Approve First Online Casino Gambling License

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports (https://bit.ly/2uzCvj8) the license was granted to South Point Casino LLC, which plans to offer poker, blackjack and other table games on the internet starting this summer.

The company is affiliated with South Point Hotel, Casino and Spa in Las Vegas.

#  Could Nevada Soon Be The Next Major Online Gambling Destination? 

Nevada is one of the most gambling-friendly states in the US, and it could soon become a major destination for online gambling as well.

There are currently more than 30 states that have legalized some form of online gambling, and Nevada is one of the few that has not yet joined that list. However, there are signs that this may soon change.

Earlier this year, the Nevada Senate passed a bill that would legalize online poker and casino games. The bill still needs to be approved by the Assembly and signed by the governor, but it seems likely that it will eventually be passed.

Once the bill is enacted, Nevada will join New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania as one of the largest online gambling markets in the US. In fact, New Jersey already has a well-developed online gambling market, with dozens of operators offering their services to residents of the state.

So why is Nevada interested in legalizing online gambling? There are several reasons. First, it could help to generate much-needed tax revenue for the state. Second, it could help to create jobs in the casino industry. And third, it could attract more tourists to Nevada casinos.

In addition to those benefits, there is also evidence that online gambling can be helpful for Problem Gamblers. A study published last year by University of Cambridge researchers found that online gambling can help problem gamblers avoid social isolation and improve their mental health.

All in all, it seems clear that Nevada will soon legalizing online gambling. This will benefit both the state and its residents, and could make Nevada one of the top destinations for online gaming in North America.
