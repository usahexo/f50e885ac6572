This means that players will have to make a decision within that time frame or they will automatically fold their hand.<br>Many poker players feel that this change will simply lead to more mistakes being made, as well as increasing the pressure on players and making the game less fun. In addition, there are concerns that this rule change could lead to collusion, as players will now have to make decisions more quickly.<br>Another of the rule changes that has caused concern is the one that allows for re-buys during a tournament up until the final table. This has been met with criticism from many players who feel that it gives an unfair advantage to those who can afford to keep buying back in.<br>The WSOP has responded to these concerns by saying that they are still testing these rule changes and that they may not necessarily be implemented in the same way when the tournaments actually take place. They also point out that there are other rule changes which have been introduced with the aim of making the game more fair and enjoyable for all players.</p>
<h1 id="Live-poker-888-announces-major-changes-to-Texas-Hold’em"><a href="#Live-poker-888-announces-major-changes-to-Texas-Hold’em" class="headerlink" title="Live poker 888 announces major changes to Texas Hold’em!"></a>Live poker 888 announces major changes to Texas Hold’em!</h1><p>888 has announced a number of changes to Texas Hold’em which will take effect on 1st September 2017. The most significant change is the reduction of the Big Blind’s value from 2 chips to 1 chip. This change was made with the aim of speeding up the game and making it more exciting for players.</p>
<p>In addition, the maximum number of raises in a round will be reduced from 4 to 3. This will help to prevent excessive betting and keep the game moving along at a reasonable pace. Finally, the number of community cards (the flop, turn and river) will be reduced from 5 to 4. This change is also intended to speed up the game.</p>
<p>While some poker players may not be happy with these changes, they are likely to result in a more enjoyable and faster-paced game for all players involved.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Hold’em-poker-hands-revealed-by-live-888"><a href="#Texas-Hold’em-poker-hands-revealed-by-live-888" class="headerlink" title="Texas Hold’em poker hands revealed by live 888!"></a>Texas Hold’em poker hands revealed by live 888!</h1><p>There are all sorts of poker hands and no two are the same. This can make things difficult for players, who are often trying to calculate the odds of their hand winning. Luckily, help is at hand! The team at live 888 have produced a guide to the hands in Texas Hold’em poker, complete with pictures.</p>
<p>To start with, let’s take a look at the strongest hands:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Royal flush: an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the same suit. This is the best hand possible and is unbeatable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straight flush: five consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four of a kind: four cards of the same rank.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Full house: three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For example, three eights and two kings would be a full house.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flush: five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence (e.g., five hearts).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straight: five cards in sequence but not of the same suit (e.g., Ace-2-3-4-5). Note that Aces can be high or low in this hand type – for example 2-3-4-5-6 would be a straight as well).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three of a kind: three cards of the same rank (e.g., three queens).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s move on to some less powerful hands:</p>
<p>1 Two pair: two pairs of different ranks (e.g., two tens and two sixes).</p>
<p>2 One pair: one pair of a specific rank (e.g., one queen).<br>3 High card: when no other combination applies, this is the highest ranking card in your hand (e.g., if you are holding an Ace, a Two, a Three and a Four, your high card would be an Ace).</p>
<h1 id="Poker-players-react-to-new-live-888-Texas-Hold’em-rules"><a href="#Poker-players-react-to-new-live-888-Texas-Hold’em-rules" class="headerlink" title="Poker players react to new live 888 Texas Hold’em rules!"></a>Poker players react to new live 888 Texas Hold’em rules!</h1><p>888 announced a new set of live poker rules that have been causing a stir in the poker community. The new rules are meant to increase the speed of the game and make it more exciting for players, but not everyone is on board with the changes. Poker pros and avid players have taken to social media and online forums to express their thoughts on 888’s new rules.</p>
<p>The most controversial change is the addition of time clocks for all rounds of play. This means that players will have a set amount of time to make decisions, or they will be forced to fold. Some players feel that this could lead to rushed decisions and wrong calls, while others believe that it will add excitement and urgency to the game.</p>
<p>Another change that has caused some debate is the reduction of the number of big blinds in later rounds. In previous versions of 888 Texas Hold’em, the big blind doubled in value every other round. However, this has now been changed so that the big blind only doubles in value once, during the final round. Some people feel that this gives an advantage to aggressive players who can take control of the game early on, while others believe that it makes for a more exciting finish.</p>
<p>So far, reaction to 888’s new live poker rules has been mixed. While some people are up in arms about the changes, others seem to be embracing them. It will be interesting to see how things play out as more people get used to the new rules. In any case, it’s sure to make for an interesting game!</p>
<h1 id="Poker-pros-sound-off-on-new-Texas-Hold’em-changes-by-live-888"><a href="#Poker-pros-sound-off-on-new-Texas-Hold’em-changes-by-live-888" class="headerlink" title="Poker pros sound off on new Texas Hold’em changes by live 888"></a>Poker pros sound off on new Texas Hold’em changes by live 888</h1><p>Texas Hold’em is one of the oldest and most popular poker variants in the world. However, there have been some recent changes to the game that have left some poker pros divided on how well it will play out.</p>
<h1 id="The-flop"><a href="#The-flop" class="headerlink" title="The flop"></a>The flop</h1><p>One of the biggest changes to the game comes with how the flop is dealt. Previously, two cards were dealt face down, followed by a single card face up. Under the new rules, three cards are dealt face up, with players only being able to see two of them. This leaves a lot more room for hands like two pairs or even a full house to go undetected.</p>
<p>While this may lead to more exciting gameplay, as players are less likely to know what they’re up against, some believe that this will simply make it harder for novice players to learn the game. It also makes it easier for experienced players to bluff as they know exactly what cards their opponents can see.</p>
<h1 id="Betting-rounds"><a href="#Betting-rounds" class="headerlink" title="Betting rounds"></a>Betting rounds</h1><p>The betting rounds have also changed in Texas Hold’em. Previously, after the flop was dealt, there would be three more rounds of betting, with the final round taking place after all of the cards had been revealed. Under the new rules, there are just two rounds of betting - one after the flop and one after the turn. This speeds up gameplay and makes it less complicated for beginners.</p>
<p>However, some poker pros feel that this takes away from some of the strategy involved in the game. With less opportunity to bluff and maneuver your way into a winning hand, some believe that the outcome of each hand is now more dependent on luck than ever before.</p>
