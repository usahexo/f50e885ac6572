<p>Mornar, a 4-1 underdog according to the betting market, pulled off an upset at the EPT Monte Carlo Main Event after winning a key pot against Philipp Gruissem. The pot was significant because it put Mornar in position to make a deep run in the tournament.</p>
<p>The hand began when Gruissem opened for 3,000 from early position and Mornar called from the big blind. The flop came 9♥7♣4♠ and Mornar check-called a bet of 4,000. The turn was the 2♦ and Mornar checked again. Gruissem then bet 8,000 which Mornar called.</p>
<p>The river was the 8♠ and Mornar led out for 16,000. Gruissem quickly folded his cards and revealed Q♥J♥, good for top pair but no kicker.</p>
<p>“I thought he had something like A♦J♦ or something like that,” said Mornar after the hand. “I had A♥9♥ so I didn’t really care if he hit his flush or not.”</p>
<p>The hand helped propel Mornar to a final table where he would eventually finish in sixth place for €191,600.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-In-Position-in-Poker"><a href="#How-to-Play-In-Position-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="How to Play In Position in Poker"></a>How to Play In Position in Poker</h1><p>Almost every poker player has heard that they should play in position as much as possible. But what does playing in position actually mean, and how can you put it into practice at the table?</p>
<p>Playing in position means that you are last to act in a betting round. This gives you a major advantage, as you can see what everyone else does before deciding how to play your hand. You can also control the size of the pot by betting or checking, depending on the strength of your hand.</p>
<p>There are several things to keep in mind when playing in position:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to only play hands that you would be willing to bet or raise with. There’s no point playing a weak hand just because you’re in position; you’ll only end up losing money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When bluffing, make sure your odds are good enough that it’s worth risking a bet. Bluffing is more profitable when done from late position, as there’s a greater chance of your opponent folding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pay attention to what your opponents are doing. If they are aggressive players who like to bet often, then it might be wise to fold weaker hands. On the other hand, if your opponents are passive and tend to only call bets, then you can afford to take more risks with your hands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips and using position to your advantage, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a winning poker player.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-In-Position-Mean-in-Poker"><a href="#What-Does-In-Position-Mean-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What Does In Position Mean in Poker?"></a>What Does In Position Mean in Poker?</h1><p>In poker, position is one of the most important factors to consider when making a decision. Position means being in a particular place at the table in relation to the other players. The earlier you are in position, the better your hand will need to be in order to bet or raise. The later you are in position, the weaker your hand can be and still call a bet or raise.</p>
<p>There are nine positions at a poker table, starting from the left of the dealer and going around clockwise:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the gun (UTG) - This is the first player to act preflop and is usually considered the weakest position at the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Early middle (EP) - This is the second player to act preflop and is usually between the UTG and cutoff positions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Middle middle (MP) - This is the third player to act preflop and is usually between the cutoff and button positions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Late middle (LP) - This is the fourth player to act preflop and is usually between the button and small blind positions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Small blind (SB) - This is the first live betting position and typically has half as much as it would take to get all-in as any other position at a full table. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Big blind (BB) - This is second live betting position and must post double what SB posts before cards are dealt; also known as “playing catch-up.” </p>
</li>
<li><p>Cutoff (CO) - The fifth player to act preflop, coming just after the small blind and just before the button. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Button (BTN) - The last player to act preflop, coming after cutoff and just before blinds post their hands for showdown).<br>9 Heads up (HU): There are only two players left in a hand</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="In-Position-Strategy-for-Poker-Players"><a href="#In-Position-Strategy-for-Poker-Players" class="headerlink" title="In Position Strategy for Poker Players"></a>In Position Strategy for Poker Players</h1><p>When playing poker, it is important to be aware of the different types of in-position strategies that are available to you. Each of these strategies will help you to improve your chances of winning money when playing poker, and allow you to adjust your play in order to take advantage of your position at the table.</p>
<p>The first type of in-position strategy is known as passive. When playing passively, you will refrain from betting or raising unless you have a very strong hand. This type of strategy is generally used when players are holding cards that are not very strong, as it allows them to see more cards without having to risk too much money.</p>
<p>The second type of in-position strategy is known as aggressive. When playing aggressively, you will be more likely to bet and raise with weaker hands in order to force other players out of the pot. This type of strategy can be risky, but can also be very profitable if used correctly.</p>
<p>Which type of in-position strategy you should use will depend on a number of factors, including the size of the pot, the strength of your hand, and the number of players remaining at the table. However, by understanding the different benefits that each type of strategy offers, you can better adapt your play to take advantage of your current position at the table.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-Look-for-When-Playing-In-Position-in-Poker"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-When-Playing-In-Position-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for When Playing In Position in Poker"></a>What to Look for When Playing In Position in Poker</h1><p>Playing in position is one of the most important skills a poker player can develop. Position is key because it allows you to act last on all streets of the hand, which gives you more information about what your opponents are doing and puts you in a better position to make decisions.</p>
<p>When playing in position, you should be looking for hands that have good potential to make a strong made hand or a strong draw. You also want to be looking for hands that can easily exploit your opponents’ mistakes.</p>
<p>Some of the best starting hands to play in position include pairs (especially pocket pairs), suited connectors, and small stakes pocket aces. However, you should not just be playing high cards when in position – there are many low-paired hands and suited connectors that can be profitable when played correctly.</p>
<p>Your goal when playing in position should be to make money by taking advantage of your opponents’ mistakes. You want to try and get them all-in as often as possible, since they will be making weaker decisions with less information than you. When playing in position, always keep your enemies’ tendencies in mind so that you can capitalize on them as often as possible.</p>
